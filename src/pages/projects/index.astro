    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
      I have built a lot of websites and mobile applications since I started
      back in 2016. Listed below is a non-exhaustive representation of what I
      have developed and deployed.
    </p>
    <h2>Apps</h2>
    <ul>
      {
        apps.map((app) => (
          <li>
            <a
              target={app.link.startsWith('/') ? '_self' : '_blank'}
              href={app.link}
            >
              {app.heading}
            </a>
            <p class="mt-1">{app.description}</p>
          </li>
        ))
      }
    </ul>
    <h2>Websites</h2>
    <ul>
      {
        websites.map((website) => (
          <li>
            <a target="_blank" href={website.link}>
              {website.title}
            </a>
            <p class="mt-1">{website.description}</p>
          </li>
        ))
      }
    </ul>
  </div>
</Layout>
