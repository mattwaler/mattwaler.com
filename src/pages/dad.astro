    <h1>Well Dad, since you hate gifts and parties so much...</h1>
    <p>
      I figured I would take a page out of your book and <strong>make</strong> something
      for you, something that I plan on supporting for the rest of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have taught me so many things, too many to count. But more
      importantly, you taught me what family really means. It means showing up
      for one another, supporting one another, and most of all, loving one
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are the foundation that our family is built upon, and such a great
      role model for what it means to be a father. I am so lucky that not only did I get the best father, I got a best friend too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Underneath this text is a living breathing list of just some of the things you've taught me. You may not have said these directly, but I learned them from you nonetheless. I plan on adding another lesson every year for the rest of my life, because I know you still have so much to teach me.
