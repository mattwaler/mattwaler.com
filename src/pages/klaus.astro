  <h1>Taking Care of Klaus</h1>
  <p>A cheat sheet for taking care of Klaus!</p>
  <h2>Feeding Schedule</h2>
  <p>
    We feed Klaus at 8:45 AM for breakfast and again at 3:45 PM for dinner. His
    food container is located on the floor inside of the hallway closet adjacent
    to the kitchen.
  </p>
  <p>
    For both meals, we give him 3 full scoops of the provided 1/4 cup measuring
    cup into his blue slow feed container, which is probably in the drying rack
    next to the sink!
  </p>
  <p>
    We also give him 1/2 of an allergy pill (generic zyrtec) with each meal,
    which are located in the white Frenchie shaped container on the island above
    and to the left when you are standing in front of the sink!
  </p>
  <p>
    We also treat Klaus to a "Greenie" once a day around noon. They are located
    in the upstairs hallway cabinet on the left side of the middle shelf in a
    large white resealable bag.
  </p>
  <h2>Potty Schedule</h2>
  <p>
    When Klaus is up and active, we usually take him out every 2ish hours.
    However, if he is drinking water and playing heavily, be sure to take him
    out as soon as playtime is over to avoid an accident!
  </p>
  <p>
    Klaus usually poops 2-3 times a day, once right in the morning, another time
    between noon and two, and occasionally around bedtime.
  </p>
  <h2>Crating Klaus</h2>
  <p>
    We also crate Klaus when we leave the house. To get Klaus into the crate,
    remove any leashes or collars on him first, and leave a few treats like a
    breadcrumb trail towards the crate, with a couple also inside towards the
    back of the crate. You may have to coax him by saying "Crate" in a cute
    voice to get him to move towards the treats! When he goes in, close and lock
    the door behind him please!
  </p>
  <p>
    Please make sure the only things in his crate when you leave are his snuggle
    buddy dog toy, his blue nyla-bone, and a small blanket or two.
  </p>
  <p>
    Klaus can spend up to 4 hours in the crate if tired out sufficiently before
    leaving!
  </p>
  <p>
    At bedtime, we take the crate into our bedroom (last door on the right at
    the end of the hallway) and place it next to the dresser, to the right of
    the wall plug located there. If you are staying overnight, you can move the
    crate into the bedroom and sleep in the bed!
  </p>
  <h2>Treats & Supplies</h2>
  <p>
    We have a couple of black magnetic pouches around the house filled with
    treats that you can use for Klaus. One is attached to the leash, and two
    others should be in the storage bin on our hall tree next to the door that
    goes out into the garage. Extra treats may be found in a blue resealable bag
    inside the same hallway cabinet bin that contains the "Greenies!"
  </p>
  <p>
    All of Klaus's treats, medications, and cleaning supplies are located in the
    hallway cabinet bin.
  </p>
  <h2>Other Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Klaus can generally be trusted upstairs, but be sure to keep the bedrooms,
    office, and pocket door to the basement closed throughout the day to avoid
    him sneaking off into those rooms and causing trouble.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not leave Klaus unwatched in the basement, and if you are down there, do
    not let him jump up onto the couch. He has a tendency to try and mark it!
  </p>
  <p>
    If you notice his face folds are looking damp or red, you can use a tissue
    from the living room table and wipe them out!
  </p>
  <p>
    After Klaus goes to the bathroom, you may want to dab him afterwards or else
    you might find some marks on your clothes if he decides to sit on your lap
    when he gets sleepy!
