    <h1>Taking Care of Klaus</h1>
    <p>A cheat sheet for taking care of Klaus!</p>
    <h2>Feeding Schedule</h2>
    <p>
      We feed Klaus at 8:45 AM for breakfast and again at 3:45 PM for dinner.
      His food container is located in the hallway closet next to the chimney on
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      For both meals, give him 3 full scoops into his blue slow feed container,
      which is probably in the drying rack next to the sink!
    </p>
    <p>
      We also give him one half of an allergy pill with each meal, which are
      located in the Frenchie shaped container on the island above and to the
      left when you are standing in front of the sink!
    </p>
    <p>
      We also treat Klaus to a "Greenie" once a day around noon. They are
      located in the hallway cabinet on the middle shelf on the left side in a
      large white sealable bag.
    </p>
    <h2>Potty Schedule</h2>
    <p>
      When Klaus is up and active, we usually take him out every 2ish hours.
      However, if he is drinking water and playing heavily, be sure to take him
      out as soon as playtime is over to avoid an accident!
    </p>
    <p>
      Klaus usually poops 2-3 times a day, once right in the morning, another
      time between noon and two, and occasionally around bedtime.
    </p>
    <h2>Crating Klaus</h2>
    <p>
      We crate Klaus when we leave the house. To get Klaus into the crate, take off any leashes or collars first, and leave a few treats like a breadcrumb trail towards the crate, with a couple inside in the back of the crate. When he goes in, close and lock the door behind him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Please make sure the only things in his crate when you leave are his snuggle buddy toy, his blue nyla-bone, and a blanket or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Klaus can do up to 4 hours in the crate if tired out sufficiently before leaving!
    </p>
    <p>
      At bedtime, we take the crate into our bedroom and place it next to the dresser. If you are staying overnight, you can move the crate into the bedroom and sleep in the bed!
    </p>
    <h2>Treats & Supplies</h2>
    <p>
      We have a couple pouches around the house filled with treats that you can use with Klaus. One is attached to the leash, and two others should be in the storage bin on our hall tree next to the door out into the garage.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of Klaus's treats, medications, and cleaning supplies are located in the hallway drawer.
    </p>
    <h2>Other Notes</h2>
    <p>
      Klaus can generally be trusted upstairs, but be sure to keep the guest
      room and bedroom doors closed throughout the day to avoid him sneaking off
      into those rooms and causing trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not leave Klaus unwatched in the basement, and if you are down there, do not let him jump up onto the couch.
      He has a tendency to try and mark it!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you notice his face folds are looking damp or red, you can use a tissue
      from the living room table and wipe them out!
    </p>
    <p>
      After Klaus goes to the bathroom, you may want to dab him afterwards or
      else you might find some marks on your close if he decides to sit on your
      lap when he gets sleepy!
