## The sky's the limit

In 11ty, you are able to customize the filetype of the exported template just by appending any filetype to the **permalink** field.

In the following example, I am looping over a pretend posts collection inside 11ty to build a JSON file of data.

```twig
---
permalink: /api/posts.json
---

{{ collections.posts | dump(2) | raw }}
```

This template will output the following JSON file.

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Fake Post 1",
    "description": "Quis platea ut dolor dictumst felis",
    "url": "/posts/1/"
  },
  {
    "title": "Fake Post 2",
    "description": "Quis platea ut dolor dictumst felis",
    "url": "/posts/2/"
  },
  {
    "title": "Fake Post 3",
    "description": "Quis platea ut dolor dictumst felis",
    "url": "/posts/3/"
  }
]
```

With this data now exported to a file in your site, you could consume it with a library like axios (or fetch if you're hardcore) in order to build out functionalities like search and sorting/filtering with a library like Svelte!

Here is how you would now access your new JSON file.

```js
import axios from 'axios'

async function getPosts() {
  const { data } = await axios.get('/api/posts.json')
  return data
}
```

Note! You can also configure all files in a directory to output to JSON by adding a **directory data file**. That file can look something like this:

```js
// File: /pages/api/api.11tydata.js
module.exports = {
  permalink: '/api/{{ page.fileSlug }}.json',
}
```

This will automatically export any templates inside this directory straight to JSON!

Eleventy is a fantastic platform and it has the potential to exceed traditional static site generation to include data files that can be consumed and made more dynamic on your site!
