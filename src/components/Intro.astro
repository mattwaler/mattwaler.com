    Hello! I’m Matt Waler, a website and application developer from Ohio. I
    focus on building clean, maintainable web and mobile apps.

  <p class="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-400">
    I care deeply about writing code that’s simple, pragmatic, and easy to
    read, with no unnecessary complexity.

    When I am not working, I am most likely playing tennis, lifting weights, or at the nearest Chipotle.
