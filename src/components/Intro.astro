    Hi, I’m Matt Waler, a developer and software engineer based in Ohio. I
    focus on building clean, maintainable web and mobile apps using tools like
    React, Next.js, React Native, TailwindCSS, and Swift.

  <p class="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-400">
    I care deeply about writing code that’s simple, pragmatic, and easy to
    read, with no unnecessary complexity.
