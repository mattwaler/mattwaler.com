      I figured I would take a page out of your book and <strong>make</strong> something
      for you, something that I plan on updating every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have taught me so many things, too many to count. But most importantly,
      you taught me what family really means. It means showing up for one another,
      supporting one another, and most of all, loving one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are the foundation that our family is built upon, and such a great role
      model for what it means to be a father. I am so lucky that not only do I
      have a great father, I have a best friend too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is list of {{ lessons|length }} things
      you have taught me. You may not have said these verbatim, but I learned them
      from you nonetheless.
